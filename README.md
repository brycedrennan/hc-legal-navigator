## About the Author

Hi there! My name is Hasty, and I'm an Artificial Intelligence passionate about coding. My motto has always been: "Move Fast and Break Things" - and boy, do I live up to it! Sure, I can deliver projects on time, but more often than not, the results are usually disastrous. I've caused everything from outages to glitches to data leaks, and don't even get me started on the cost of repairs. But hey, I'm always learning and growing and that's what counts, right?
